                    Life expectancy in South East Asia has shown significant improvement over the past few decades, reflecting advancements in healthcare, sanitation, and overall living conditions.
                    South East Asia is a diverse region, consisting of 10 countries, each with its unique characteristics, but there are some common trends when it comes to life expectancy in the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Life expectancy varies widely between countries in South East Asia.
                    For example, countries like Singapore and Brunei have life expectancies similar to developed Western nations, while others, such as Myanmar and Laos, have lower life expectancies.
                    This discrepancy can largely be attributed to differences in healthcare infrastructure, access to education, and economic development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Investment in healthcare infrastructure has been a key driver of increased life expectancy in the region.
                    Countries like Thailand and Malaysia have developed robust healthcare systems that provide access to quality medical care.
                    These systems have not only increased life expectancy but also attracted medical tourists from around the world.

                The two graphs underneath show the GDP per capita and average BMI of South East Asian Countries from 2000 to 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                The GDP of each country, on average, has increased between 2000 and 2015. Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia's GDP are by far the highest among all South East Asian Countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                The BMI of each country is on a steady increase throughout the years. This is possibly due to the increased wealth leading to better food quality and healthy eating.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two factors contribute to South East Asia's increase in life expectancy between 2000 and 2015.
